My favorite text editor is Atom because it has Git integration, it has a lot of packages that can be installed 
with the built-in package manager, and it has auto-complete/suggestion. The git integration is a powerful feature because 
you can update your branch within the editor without having to go through the terminal.
The package-manager built-in feature is great because you can customize the editor to your liking 
or to fit the scope of your project. All of the packages are available on Git, which makes this even better. 
Lastly, the auto-complete/suggestion is something that a lot of popular editors have a version of but what
makes Atom's superior is that it quickly recognizes when you changed the spelling of a variable that has been referenced 
throughout your project and it does so intelligently.
